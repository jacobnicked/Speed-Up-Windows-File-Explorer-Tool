# Speed Up Windows File Explorer Tool

<p>Speed Up Windows File Explorer Tool speeds up File Explorer just in case, if Windows has not saved information about a folder before and tries to figure out what kind of folder it is (e.g., music, pictures, documents) by looking at every single file inside.</p>
<p>If the folder contains thousands of files, this process takes a very long time, making the folder load slowly and causing your hard disk drive (HDD) to work overtime.</p>
